Looking at the logs, the output is coming from the standard tool response behavior that shows the result of function calls.\n\nTo prevent file contents from being output in the chat, you would need to modify the implementation of the file_operations function itself. This would likely involve:\n\n1. Modifying the logging/output behavior of the function\n2. Adding a parameter to control whether results should be displayed\n\nHowever, I don't have access to modify the underlying function implementations. This appears to be a built-in behavior of how the tools report their results in this environment. The best I can suggest is to raise this as a feature request to add a \"silent\" or \"quiet\" mode parameter to the file_operations function.\n\nWould you like me to show you where in the code this output behavior is likely happening, or would you prefer to explore other approaches to handling sensitive file contents?",
